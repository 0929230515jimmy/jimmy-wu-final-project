# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Gomoku

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game kind of like bingo. Its two player that put their stone on the board and who ever gets 5 stone in a row is the winner. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It's a board game and each player will take turn to choose which position they want to put their stone by inputing the (x,y) position on the board. I have not think of what features I want to do probally only black and white more old school. Mainly I will used if and for loop to complete this project. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will at least have the game going, but I am not sure weather or not the machine can define the winner or not. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish everything except the computer defineing the winner.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope everything can be don't and have more features on the game to make it more beautiful. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I think I will need to get used to all kinds of loops in python to make sure that when I am drawing the board the outcome would be ideal. Other than that I would want to thin is their a better way other than inputting the (x,y) value for the players.
