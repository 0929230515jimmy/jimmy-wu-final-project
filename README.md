# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to do a game called Gomoku. It is kind of like bingo where people just take turn putting their own rock on the table and who ever has a connection of five rock wins. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will work by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?
So far I don't have any questions!
